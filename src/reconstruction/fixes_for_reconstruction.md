# Fixes for reconstruction

1. Model architecture changes (static -> temporal) - DONE
2. Improve loss function (add reprojection and physics losses) - DONE
3. Improve dataset representation (camera normalization, intrinsics, noise augmentation, longer trajectories) - DONE
4. Improve eval metrics (reprojection error, smoothness, velocity)
5. Try unity???
