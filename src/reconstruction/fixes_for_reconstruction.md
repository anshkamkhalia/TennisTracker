# Fixes for reconstruction

1. Model architecture changes (static -> temporal)
2. Improve loss function (add reprojection and physics losses)
3. Improve dataset representation (camera normalization, intrinsics, noise augmentation, longer trajectories)
4. Improve eval metrics (reprojection error, smoothness, velocity)
5. Try unity???
